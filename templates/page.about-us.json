A sanctuary shaped by the objects we choose to live with,<br\/>and the quiet stories they tell.<\/p><p>Just as a poet selects words for their rhythm and emotion, we<br\/>curate each piece not only for its beauty, but for its ability to evoke<br\/>something deeper: a memory, a mood, a moment of stillness. To us, great design<br\/>is about resonance. It’s the detail that softens a space, the texture that<br\/>catches the light, and the quiet joy something brings simply by being there.<\/p><p>As a boutique homewares destination, our mission is to offer<br\/>thoughtfully curated pieces that elevate the story of your home. With<br\/>collections designed both in-house and sourced from artisans across the globe,<br\/>we focus on timeless beauty, refined luxury, and enduring style.<\/p><p>From luxurious materials to rich textures and harmonious<br\/>colour palettes, every piece is chosen to bring intention, beauty, and joy into<br\/>your everyday. <\/p><p>We hope you enjoy exploring our collections <em> <\/em>and we welcome you into our world. xx<\/p>","link_text":"","link_url":"","background":"#fdfbfa","background_gradient":"","text_color":"#333333","text_gradient":"","button_background":"","button_text_color":""}}},"block_order":["image_KpHmrn"],"name":"Media with text","settings":{"full_width":true,"alternate_media_position":false,"spacing":"small"}},"media_with_text_wUwWGN":{"type":"media-with-text","blocks":{"image_QhqQPH":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Collage2_158d7685-0527-4595-890a-2b50da58a1a8.jpg","media_width":35,"media_position":"start","text_position":"place-self-center-start text-start","icon":"none","icon_width":120,"subheading":"","title":"The Founder","content":"<p>Alison MacCormick is the founder, creative director, and designer behind Poème Home.

Caring for your honed marble products to keep them looking pristine requires the following recommendations:<\/li><li>Wipe spills promptly to avoid them soaking into the surface.Â  Use a soft microfibre cloth or paper towel to blot, not wipe, so you don't spread the liquid.<\/li><li>For everyday cleaning, use warm water and mild pH neutral dish soap. Gently wipe down the surface with a dampened soft cloth or microfiber towel.<\/li><li>Rinse with water after cleaning and dry with a soft cloth.<\/li><li>Lightly buff the surface with a soft microfibre cloth to help restore the honed finish and remove light stains.<\/li><li>This can also help maintain the matte appearance of the marble.<\/li><li>Avoid cleaning products with bleach, ammonia, or acidic ingredients. These can dull the finish or damage the stone over time.<\/li><li>Avoid direct contact with acidic or oily substances, like coffee, wine, vinegars, cheese, cooking oils, as they can discolour the surface.<\/li><li>Do not leave marble surfaces wet for long periods. Always dry the marble after cleaning or after exposure to water to avoid water spots and potential stains.<\/li><li>By following these simple maintenance tips, you'll help preserve your honed marble and keep it looking beautiful without the risk of stains or surface damage.<\/li><\/ul>","page":""}},"buy_buttons":{"type":"buy_buttons","settings":{"show_payment_button":true,"show_gift_card_recipient":true,"atc_button_background":"","atc_button_text_color":"","payment_button_background":"","payment_button_text_color":""}}},"block_order":["title","price","variant_picker","quantity_selector","description","collapsible_text_AiAKg7","buy_buttons"],"settings":{"full_width":true,"show_fixed_add_to_cart":true,"desktop_media_width":55,"desktop_media_layout":"carousel_thumbnails_left","mobile_media_size":"expanded","mobile_carousel_control":"floating_dots","enable_video_autoplay":false,"enable_video_looping":true,"enable_image_zoom":true,"max_image_zoom_level":3,"background":"","background_gradient":"","text_color":"","input_background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","input_text_color":""}},"related-products":{"type":"related-products","settings":{"recommendations_count":6,"products":[],"full_width":true,"stack_products":true,"show_progress_bar":false,"products_per_row_mobile":"1","products_per_row_desktop":3,"subheading":"","title":"You may also like","content":"","background":"#ffffff","background_gradient":"","text_color":"","heading_color":"","heading_gradient":"","product_card_background":"","product_card_text_color":""}},"media_grid_3LaYPj":{"type":"media-grid","blocks":{"image_cnzmjw":{"type":"image","settings":{"title":"","heading_tag":"h4","link_url":"","link_text":"","mobile_text_position":"place-self-center text-center","desktop_column_span":2,"desktop_row_span":1,"desktop_text_position":"sm:place-self-center sm:text-center","background":"#000000","background_gradient":"","text_color":"#ffffff","text_gradient":"","button_background":"#000000","button_text_color":"#ffffff","overlay_color":"#000000","overlay_opacity":0}},"image_CMi7DQ":{"type":"image","settings":{"title":"","heading_tag":"h4","link_url":"","link_text":"","mobile_text_position":"place-self-center text-center","desktop_column_span":2,"desktop_row_span":2,"desktop_text_position":"sm:place-self-center sm:text-center","background":"#000000","background_gradient":"","text_color":"#ffffff","text_gradient":"","button_background":"#000000","button_text_color":"#ffffff","overlay_color":"#000000","overlay_opacity":0}},"image_Mhcwax":{"type":"image","settings":{"title":"","heading_tag":"h4","link_url":"","link_text":"","mobile_text_position":"place-self-center text-center","desktop_column_span":2,"desktop_row_span":1,"desktop_text_position":"sm:place-self-center sm:text-center","background":"#000000","background_gradient":"","text_color":"#ffffff","text_gradient":"","button_background":"#000000","button_text_color":"#ffffff","overlay_color":"#000000","overlay_opacity":0}}},"block_order":["image_cnzmjw","image_CMi7DQ","image_Mhcwax"],"name":"Media grid","settings":{"full_width":true,"reduce_width":false,"desktop_row_height":290,"mobile_row_height":150,"background":"","background_gradient":""}},"rich_text_YXDFKP":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"subheading_C6B6ef":{"type":"subheading","settings":{"text":"Subheading"}},"heading_rW8PLW":{"type":"heading","settings":{"text":"Heading","heading_tag":"h1","text_color":"","gradient":""}},"richtext_7maYwT":{"type":"richtext","settings":{"content":"<p>Use this text to share information about your brand with your customers.
